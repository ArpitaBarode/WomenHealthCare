<h3>1. Do take a multivitamin</h3>
<p>Eating a balanced diet that’s rich in vitamins and minerals is the best way to 
  provide your body with all of the healthy nutrients it needs 
  to support a growing baby. A healthy diet alone, however, may not be enough for pregnancy.</p>
  <p>
  <a href="/health/pregnancy/best-prenatal-vitamins" class="content-link css-5r4717">Prenatal vitamins</a>
  contain higher levels of certain nutrients that expectant mothers require at higher doses, such as:
  </p>
  <ul><li>folic acid</li><li>calcium</li><li>iron</li></ul>
 <p>These vitamins assist with proper development of the fetus and help prevent birth defects.
   Your doctor can help you find a multivitamin or a series of vitamins that are best for you.</p>
   <p>
   <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/multivitamins-womens-health" class="content-link css-5r4717">multivitamin</a>
   will usually include DHA, EPA, or both. These are omega-3 fats that are important for your baby’s proper brain development.
   </p>
   <p>
  <b> Don’t take more than one dose of multivitamins, though. Some vitamins in higher amounts can be harmful to the baby.</b>
   </p>
   <img class="img123" src="img/vit.jpg"><img>
   <h3>2. Do get lots of sleep</h3>
   <p>Changing hormone levels, anticipation, and anxiety can make sleep elusive during your 9 months of pregnancy.
     Pregnancy is demanding, especially in the final trimester, and you’ll need your sleep.</p>
     <p>
     Take a quick snooze if you feel tired and schedule naps whenever you can. Set bedtimes and stick to them.
     </p>
     <p>Aim for 7-9 hours of shut-eye each night.
       Fatigue is a sign that your body needs more rest, so give yourself all the sleep you can.</p>
       <img class="img123" src="img/s1 (2).jpg"><img>
       <h3>3. Do work out</h3>
       <p>Gone are the days of pregnant women avoiding lifting a finger
         during their pregnancies: We now know that exercise is good for mama and baby.</p>
         <p>In fact, regular exercise may help you combat many of the issues that arise during pregnancy, including:</p>
         <ul><li>insomnia</li><li>muscle pain</li><li>excessive weight gain</li><li>mood problems</li></ul>
         <p>If you regularly exercised before you became pregnant, keep it up.
           Talk with your doctor about any adjustments you should make to your routine,
           especially as you move into your second and third trimesters.</p>
           <p>
           If you didn’t exercise regularly before you found out you were expecting,
            ask your doctor about incorporating a fitness routine into your day. 
           They can guide you into a program that’s safe and comfortable for you and your growing baby.
           </p>
           <img class="img123" src="img/w1.avif"><img>
           <h3>4. Do practice yoga</h3>
           <p>You should avoid Bikram or hot yoga, but other yoga modalities are fine when you’re expecting. 
            Seek out prenatal or gentle yoga classes that are designed for mothers-to-be.
             Instructors in these classes will know which poses are best and which you should avoid.</p>
             <p>If you weren’t doing yoga before you became pregnant, talk with your doctor before signing up for a class. 
              While it’s possible you can start, it’s best to go over the risks and concerns with your doctor.</p>

              <h3> 5. Do have sex</h3>
              <p>Sex during pregnancy is fine, as long as you don’t have a
                 complicating factor such as placenta previa or another type of high-risk pregnancy.</p>
                 <p>
                 Sex is safe with your partner right up until your water breaks. If you have discomfort you may have to try new positions. 
                 Talk with your doctor if you have any questions about the safety of intercourse during your pregnancy.
                 </p>
                 <div id="donts">Pregnancy Don’ts </div>
                 <h3> 1. Don’t smoke</h3>
                 <p>Babies born to women who smoke during pregnancy are</p>
                 <p>Mothers who smoke are more likely to deliver their babies early. 
                  Preterm delivery is a leading cause of death, disability, and disease among newborns.</p>
                  <p> to have a lower birth weight and are at a greater risk for learning 
                    disabilities than children born to nonsmoking mothers.
                    One in every five babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy has low birth weight.
                     Mothers who are exposed to secondhand smoke while pregnant are more likely to have lower birth weight babies.
                     Babies born too small or too early are not as healthy
                    </p>
                    <h3> 2. Don’t drink alcohol</h3>
                    <p>Alcohol may greatly impact your baby’s development. People who drink alcohol while pregnant</p>
                    <p>Symptoms of FAS include:</p>
                    <ul><li>low birth weight</li><li>learning disabilities</li><li>behavior problems

                    </li><li>lagging patterns in terms of growth and development milestones</li></ul>
                    <p>Even small amounts of alcohol can be a problem. There appears to be no safe level of alcohol 
                      intake in pregnancy.</p>
                      <p>If you need help stopping drinking while you’re pregnant, talk with your doctor as soon as possible.
                         The sooner you get help, the healthier your baby is likely to be.</p>
                         <h3>3. Don’t eat raw meat</h3>
                         <p>Raw and undercooked meat and eggs carry the risk of foodborne illness, 
                          such as listeriosis and toxoplasmosis. Food poisoning is also a possibility.</p>
                          <p>These conditions can cause serious, life-threatening illnesses that could lead to severe birth defects and even miscarriage. 
                            Make sure all eggs and meat that you eat while pregnant are well-cooked.</p>
                            <h3> 4. Don’t eat deli meat</h3>
                            <p>
                            Deli meats — including hot dogs, sausages, smoked salmon, and other cured meats — can cause foodborne illness,
                             such as listeriosis and toxoplasmosis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Meats that are sliced have far more surface area for bacterial growth. 
                            Thoroughly cooking these processed proteins well reduces your risk.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            It’s also important to eat pasteurized (not raw) milk and cheese. Always wash produce to help eliminate harmful bacteria.
                            </p>
                            <h3>5. Don’t drink a lot of caffeine</h3>
                            <p>Caffeine can travel through the placenta and increase your baby’s heart rate.</p>
                            <p><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy-nutrition/art-20043844?pg=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-5r4717">Current research</a> suggests that women can safely consume a cup or two of coffee each day, 
                            but forego downing a triple-shot latte while you’re carrying.</p>
